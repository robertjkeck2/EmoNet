# Ryerson Audio-Visual Database of Emotional Speech and Song (RAVDESS)

## Audio, Speech Portion
This portion of the RAVDESS contains 1440 files: 60 trials per actor x 24 actors = 1440. The RAVDESS contains 24 professional actors (12 female, 12 male), vocalizing two lexically-matched statements in a neutral North American accent. Speech emotions includes calm, happy, sad, angry, fearful, surprise, and disgust expressions. Each expression is produced at two levels of emotional intensity (normal, strong), with an additional neutral expression.

### File naming convention
Each of the 1440 files has a unique filename. The filename consists of a 7-part numerical identifier (e.g., 03-01-06-01-02-01-12.wav). These identifiers define the stimulus characteristics:

### Filename identifiers
 - Modality (01 = full-AV, 02 = video-only, 03 = audio-only).
 - Vocal channel (01 = speech, 02 = song).
 - Emotion (01 = neutral, 02 = calm, 03 = happy, 04 = sad, 05 = angry, 06 = fearful, 07 = disgust, 08 = surprised).
 - Emotional intensity (01 = normal, 02 = strong). NOTE: There is no strong intensity for the 'neutral' emotion.
 - Statement (01 = "Kids are talking by the door", 02 = "Dogs are sitting by the door").
 - Repetition (01 = 1st repetition, 02 = 2nd repetition).
 - Actor (01 to 24. Odd numbered actors are male, even numbered actors are female).
